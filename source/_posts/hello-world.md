Welcome! This is the first post on my personal homepage.

Here you will find notes on what I am building, what I am learning, and ideas worth keeping.

## What This Site Is For

- A **blog** where I can write down thoughts and lessons learned.
- A **home base** that links to my projects and profiles.
- A **sandbox** to try out new tools, themes, and layouts.

## What You Can Expect

- Short posts focused on practice and real experience.
- Occasional deep dives into topics I find interesting.
- Updates to the projects listed on the Projects page.

Thanks for stopping by &mdash; feel free to look around the About and Projects pages to get a better sense of who I am and what I do.
