## About Me

Hi, I’m Zion Peng, a scholar who enjoys applying effective and reliable machine-learning method to real world challenges.

I created this homepage to share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and a few milestones I have achieved.

## What I Do

- **Web development**: Building modern, responsive websites and web apps.
- **Learning & writing**: Taking notes on what I learn and turning them into articles.
- **Side projects**: Experimenting with small tools, automations, and UI ideas.

## Beyond Code

Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, exploring new ideas, and improving how I think and work.

This site is a simple place to collect all of that in one home.
