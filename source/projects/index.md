## Featured Projects

### Project One &mdash; Personal Homepage

This site itself is a small project: a lightweight personal homepage built with **Hexo** and the **NexT** theme.
The goal is to keep it fast, minimal, and focused on content.

### Project Two &mdash; Example App

An example web application used to experiment with new ideas, patterns, and UI concepts.
It’s a playground for trying things out and learning in public.

## How I Build Things

- **Simple first**: Start with the core idea, then polish over time.
- **Readable code**: Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- **Long-term mindset**: Fewer but more meaningful projects.

More projects will appear here as they are ready to share.
